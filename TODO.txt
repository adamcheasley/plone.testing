plone.testing TODO
==================

* Implement all layers and helpers listed in the reference in the README.
* Revise README to reflect implementation as necessary

* The Zope BASIC_SITE may need a non-administrative user by default

* installProduct() is global and cannot be easily torn down. Maybe we need an
  uninstallProduct()?
  
* It'd be useful to be able to "stack" component registries for effective
  sandboxing and layer tear-down. Perhaps the ``z3c.baseregistry`` approach
  is useful here?

* Define Plone layers (in plone.app.testing)

    - Should not have any content or non-standard products installed
    - Should use a well-defined minimal workflow
    - Should have a single user with role Member
    - Helpers:
        - install extension profile
        - install product using portal_quickinstaller (discourage?)
        - create user
