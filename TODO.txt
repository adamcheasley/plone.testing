plone.testing TODO
==================

* Better tests for installProduct() and uninstallProduct()

* Add z3c.autoinclude "off switch" to STARTUP layer? Or just in Plone?

* Ensure zope.testbrowser works - do we need any of the stuff in
  functional.py in ZopeTestCase?

* Define Plone layers (in plone.app.testing)

    - Should not have any content or non-standard products installed
    - Should use a well-defined minimal workflow
    - Should have a single user with role Member
    - Helpers:
        - install extension profile
        - install product using portal_quickinstaller (discourage?)
        - create user
