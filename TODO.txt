plone.testing TODO
==================

* Add z3c.autoinclude "off switch" to STARTUP layer
* Write uninstallProduct()

* It'd be useful to be able to "stack" component registries for effective
  sandboxing and layer tear-down. Perhaps the ``z3c.baseregistry`` approach
  is useful here?
    
    - would make for better tear-down of z2.STARTUP
    - would make it easier to load components and tear down properly in own layers

* Define Plone layers (in plone.app.testing)

    - Should not have any content or non-standard products installed
    - Should use a well-defined minimal workflow
    - Should have a single user with role Member
    - Helpers:
        - install extension profile
        - install product using portal_quickinstaller (discourage?)
        - create user

* Ensure zope.testbrowser works - do we need any of the stuff in
  functional.py in ZopeTestCase?
