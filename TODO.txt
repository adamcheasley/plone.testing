plone.testing TODO
==================

* The ZCML_DIRECTIVES layers should not extend SANDBOX

* Create a child of z2.BASIC_SITE that has:
    - A Manager user
    - A regular user
    - A folder owned by the regular user
    - Loads ZCML?

* Write uninstallProduct()

* Tear down app during BASIC_SITE tear-down

* Write tests for Zope 2 layer

* Implement all layers and helpers listed in the reference in the README.
* Revise README to reflect implementation as necessary
  
* It'd be useful to be able to "stack" component registries for effective
  sandboxing and layer tear-down. Perhaps the ``z3c.baseregistry`` approach
  is useful here?

* Define Plone layers (in plone.app.testing)

    - Should not have any content or non-standard products installed
    - Should use a well-defined minimal workflow
    - Should have a single user with role Member
    - Helpers:
        - install extension profile
        - install product using portal_quickinstaller (discourage?)
        - create user
